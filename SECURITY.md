# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect user API credentials and sensitive data in the Algo Trading WebApp.

## Security Overview

The application implements a multi-layered security approach to protect user credentials:

1. **Client-Side Encryption**: API credentials are encrypted before storage
2. **Master Password Protection**: User-defined master password for credential encryption
3. **Secure Storage**: Encrypted data stored in browser localStorage
4. **No Plain Text Storage**: Credentials are never stored in plain text
5. **Cryptographic Best Practices**: Uses industry-standard encryption algorithms

## Security Architecture

### 1. Credential Encryption Flow

```
User Input → Master Password + API Keys → PBKDF2 Key Derivation → AES-GCM Encryption → Secure Storage
```

### 2. Key Components

- **Master Password**: User-defined password (minimum 8 characters)
- **Salt**: Random 16-byte salt for PBKDF2
- **IV**: Random 12-byte initialization vector for AES-GCM
- **Encryption Key**: 256-bit key derived from master password

### 3. Cryptographic Algorithms

- **PBKDF2**: Password-based key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- **AES-GCM**: 256-bit encryption with authenticated encryption
- **SHA-256**: Hash function for key derivation
- **Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure random values

## Implementation Details

### Secure Storage Utility (`src/utils/secureStorage.ts`)

The secure storage utility provides the following functions:

```typescript
// Encrypt credentials
encryptCredentials(apiKey, secretKey, masterPassword)

// Decrypt credentials
decryptCredentials(encryptedCredentials, masterPassword)

// Store encrypted data
storeEncryptedCredentials(username, encryptedCredentials)

// Retrieve encrypted data
getEncryptedCredentials(username)

// Validate master password
validateMasterPassword(username, masterPassword)
```

### Credential Management Class

```typescript
class SecureCredentialManager {
  async storeCredentials(apiKey, secretKey, masterPassword)
  async getCredentials(masterPassword)
  hasCredentials()
  removeCredentials()
  async validatePassword(masterPassword)
}
```

## Security Features

### 1. **No Plain Text Storage**
- API keys and secret keys are never stored in plain text
- All sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- Master password is never stored (only used for encryption/decryption)

### 2. **Strong Encryption**
- 256-bit AES encryption with GCM mode
- PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations for key derivation
- Unique salt and IV for each encryption operation

### 3. **User Control**
- Users control their own master password
- Credentials can be updated or removed at any time
- No server-side storage of sensitive data

### 4. **Browser Security**
- Uses Web Crypto API for cryptographic operations
- Encrypted data stored in browser localStorage
- No transmission of plain text credentials

## Security Best Practices

### 1. **Master Password Requirements**
- Minimum 8 characters
- Should be unique and strong
- Never share or reuse
- Consider using a password manager

### 2. **Credential Management**
- Regularly update API keys
- Use different keys for paper vs. live trading
- Monitor account activity
- Report suspicious activity immediately

### 3. **Browser Security**
- Keep browser updated
- Use HTTPS connections
- Enable browser security features
- Clear browser data when needed

## Threat Model

### Protected Against
- **XSS Attacks**: Credentials are encrypted, not plain text
- **Local Storage Access**: Data is encrypted with user's password
- **Browser Extensions**: Cannot access decrypted credentials
- **Malware**: Encrypted data is useless without master password

### Limitations
- **Master Password Compromise**: If master password is compromised, credentials can be decrypted
- **Physical Access**: If someone has access to the device and knows the master password
- **Browser Vulnerabilities**: Exploits in the browser could potentially access decrypted data

## Recommendations for Users

### 1. **Strong Master Password**
- Use a unique, strong password
- Consider using a passphrase
- Don't reuse passwords from other services
- Use a password manager for generation and storage

### 2. **Secure Environment**
- Use the application on trusted devices only
- Avoid public computers or shared devices
- Keep your device secure and updated
- Use antivirus software

### 3. **Regular Maintenance**
- Update API keys regularly
- Change master password periodically
- Monitor account activity
- Keep backup of important data

## Future Security Enhancements

### 1. **Backend Integration**
- Store encrypted credentials on secure backend
- Implement session-based authentication
- Add rate limiting and monitoring
- Implement audit logging

### 2. **Advanced Encryption**
- Hardware security modules (HSM)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Biometric authentication
- Hardware key support (YubiKey, etc.)

### 3. **Monitoring and Alerts**
- Suspicious activity detection
- Login attempt monitoring
- Geographic access controls
- Time-based access restrictions

## Compliance and Standards

The implementation follows these security standards:

- **OWASP**: Open Web Application Security Project guidelines
- **NIST**: National Institute of Standards and Technology recommendations
- **FIPS**: Federal Information Processing Standards
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation compliance

## Security Audit

### Regular Security Reviews
- Code security review
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- Security best practice updates

### Incident Response
- Security incident reporting process
- Response team contacts
- Escalation procedures
- Post-incident analysis
